# fb-3d-playground
A simple 3D wireframe playground to learn and test 3D concepts. Intended as an introductory tutorial.

This is a revised and expanded FreeBasic port of a wonderful tutorial by Lode Vandevenne that, sadly, isn't available anymore. It laid out the basic math and concepts used in the creation and representation of a 3D scene, using a pinhole camera model.

The code lets you manipulate a free looking camera and a simple paper plane wireframe model through 3D space. Use the arrow keys and the mouse to control the camera and the plane.
